# Hyperscanning_project

Analysis of brain activity recorded with EEG from multiple subjects simultaneously.

EEG data was recorded using the 8 channel EEG data acquisition system g.Unicorn Hybrid Black. This system provides high signal-to-noise ratio with 24bit and 250Hz. Data was recorded with wet electordes (gel was added to all of the electrodes). 
Raw data was preprocessed (rereferenced, filtered, cleaned) using the pipeline that can be found at the gUnicron branch of the following repository: https://github.com/AndreiZn/eSports_ERP_project/tree/gUnicorn.
